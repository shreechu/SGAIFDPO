We run a pretty complex e-commerce platform, and honestly, we've been having some stability issues that are keeping me up at night. Every outage hits revenue hard and shakes customer confidence. Before we get into the weeds, tell me a bit about yourself and how you typically help companies in our situation?",

A 15-minute blip last month cost us real money and customer trust. The board is asking questions. Talk to me about what might be driving this.
